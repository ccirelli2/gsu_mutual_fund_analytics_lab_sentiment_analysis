"0000015260-10-000035"|"of investing in the fund market. the market risks associated with investing in the fund are those related to fluctuations in the value of the fund’s portfolio. a risk of investing in stocks is that their value will go up and down reflecting stock market movements and you could lose money. foreign investment. investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve certain considerations and risks not ordinarily associated with investments in securities of domestic issuers. foreign companies are not generally subject to the same accounting, auditing, and financial standards and requirements as those applicable to u.s. companies. there may be less publicly available information about a foreign company than a u.s. company. investments in foreign securities could expose the fund to the direct or indirect consequences of political, social, or economic changes in the countries that issue the securities or in which the issuers are located. with respect to certain countries, there are risks of expropriation, confiscat ory taxation, political or social instability, or diplomatic developments that could affect assets of the fund held in those foreign countries. if the value of any foreign currency in which the fund’s investments are denominated declines relative to the u.s. dollar, the fund expects the value of its investments to decline proportionately. in addition, a portfolio that includes foreign securities can expect to have a higher expense ratio because of the increased transaction costs on non-u.s. securities markets and the increased costs of maintaining the custody of foreign securities. pricing. if market conditions make it difficult to value some investments, the fund may value these investments using more subjective methods, such as fair value pricing. in such cases, the value determined for an investment could be different than the value realized upon such investment's sale. as a result, you could pay more than the market value when buying fund shares or receive less than the market value when selling fund shares. non-diversification. the fund is non-diversified, which means that more than 5% of the fund’s assets may be invested in the securities of one issuer. as a result, the fund may hold a smaller number of issuers than if it were diversified. investing in a non-diversified fund could involve more risk than investing in a fund that holds a broader range of securities because changes in the financial condition of a single issuer could cause greater fluctuation in the fund’s total returns. concentration. the fund is subject to industry concentration risk due to its investments in gold and silver, which is the risk that the fund’s performance can be significantly affected by the developments in the precious metals and natural resources industries. investments in gold and silver. investment in gold and silver are considered speculative. the fund’s investments can be significantly affected by developments in the precious metals industries and are linked to the prices of gold and silver. these prices can be influenced by a variety of global economic, financial, and political factors and may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time and be more volatile than other types of investments. economic, political, or other conditions affecting one or more of the major sources of gold and silver could have a substantial effect on supply and demand in countries throughout the world. additionally, the majority of such producers are domiciled in a limited number of coun tries. natural resource companies. natural resource companies can be significantly affected by the supply of and demand for the indicated commodities and related services, exploration and production spending, government regulation, world events, and economic conditions. the operations and financial performance of natural resources companies may be directly affected by the prices of the indicated commodities, especially those natural resources companies for whom the commodities they own are significant assets. the stock prices of natural resources companies may experience greater price volatility than other types of common stocks. depletion and exploration risk. to maintain or increase their revenue level, natural resource companies or their customers need to maintain or expand their reserves through exploration of new sources of supply, through the development of existing sources, through acquisitions, or through long term contracts to acquire reserves. the financial performance of natural resources companies may be adversely affected if they, or the companies to whom they provide products or services, are unable to cost-effectively acquire additional products or reserves sufficient to replace the natural decline. security selection. the securities in the fund's portfolio may decline in value. portfolio management could be wrong in its analysis of industries, companies, economic trends, the relative attractiveness of different securities or other matters. securities lending. any decline in the value of a portfolio security that occurs while the security is out on loan is borne by the fund, and will adversely affect performance. also, there may be delays in recovery of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while holding the security. in-kind redemptions. the fund may require redeeming shareholders to accept readily tradable gold, silver, or other precious metals bullion, coins, etf shares or other fund holdings in complete or partial payment of redemptions. fixed income securities. the fund may invest in fixed income securities that are affected by interest rates. when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities typically fall in proportion to their maturities. fixed income securities are also subject to credit risk, i.e., the risk that an issuer of securities will be unable to pay principal and interest when due or that the value of the security will suffer because investors believe the issuer is less able to pay. many fixed income securities, especially those issued at high interest rates, provide that the issuer may repay them early. if issuers exercise this right, holders of these types of callable securities may not benefit fully from the increase in value th at other fixed income securities experience when rates decline. swiss franc assets. the swiss franc is subject to the risk that inflation will decrease in the united states or rise in switzerland. swiss government bonds are subject to some risk of default. real estate companies. any decline in the general level of prices of real estate would be expected to have an adverse impact on these stocks. the prices of such stocks are particularly vulnerable to decline in the event of deflationary economic conditions. active trading. the fund may trade securities actively. this strategy could increase transaction costs, reduce performance, and result in taxable distributions which could lower a fund’s after tax performance."|"-"
