4. Describe the steps to generate your final work product. Be sure to highlight places where you made decisions/judgments (such as setting the optimal number of topics, or choosing which approach over several tested, etc.).  If you wrote code for this project, include screen shots of the important code components implementing the step or the judgment.

5.  Identify the relevant files for the final work product (include the name and the location along with a description of the file if not self-evident from title and/or if there are multiple files.  Be over rather than under inclusive.

6.  Identify any next steps or undone work. If someone were to pick this up what else should be done, or what didn’t you have time to do this semester



### Code Tasks:
1. Update sentiment dictionary to comply with the format of the sentiment dictionary found in the data folder.
